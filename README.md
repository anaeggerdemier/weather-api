# Simple Weather Application

**Simple Weather Application** is a web application developed as part of the Alura Immersion Dev Challenge in partnership with Gemini. This project allows users to check the weather forecast for a specific city or their current location. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application employs simulated data to showcase its functionality. For privacy and security reasons, the publicly available version does not use the actual API but demonstrates the applicationâ€™s capabilities with mock data.

## Description

This project simulates weather forecasts using pre-defined data. Rather than connecting to a real API, it demonstrates the functionality with simulated information. The application features a user-friendly interface that allows users to search for weather forecasts for a specific city or view current weather conditions based on their device's location.

## Features

- **City Search**: Simulates searching for the weather forecast for a specific city using simulated data.
- **Current Location**: Simulates checking weather conditions for the user's current location with simulated data.
- **Result Display**: Shows the weather icon, temperature, and a brief description of the weather using simulated data.

## Simulated Data

The application uses simulated data to protect the real API and ensure privacy. These data are predefined and incorporated directly into the JavaScript code, replacing calls to an actual external API.

- **Simulated Data for City**: Includes information such as weather icon, description, and temperature.
- **Simulated Data for Current Location**: Includes simulated information about the current weather condition.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository URL>
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd <project directory>
    ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file in a browser to view the application.**

## Error Handling

- **Data Error**: If the simulated data is not available or there is an issue with displaying it, an error message will be shown to the user.
- **Validation Error**: If the entered city name is not valid, the system will prompt the user to enter a valid name.

## Documentation

There is no external API documentation for this project. All details are in the source code and user interface.
